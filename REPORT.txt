Introduction
In today’s digital world, secure communication is of utmost importance, especially in email systems where sensitive information is frequently exchanged. Conventional email services often lack strong security measures, making them vulnerable to various attacks, including data breaches, phishing, and unauthorized access. To address these concerns, our project focuses on implementing a Secure Email System that ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication in email exchanges between users.
Our project introduces a secure email mechanism where two users, A and B, communicate through an email server while maintaining robust encryption and verification standards. The email contents are protected using a combination of AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption techniques. A randomly generated AES key is used for symmetric encryption, while RSA public-private key pairs are generated at the email server for secure key distribution. Additionally, SHA-512 hashing is applied to the email content, ensuring data integrity.
Problem AddressedEmail communication, though widely used, faces numerous security threats, including eavesdropping, tampering, and impersonation. Existing solutions provide partial security measures, such as SSL/TLS encryption, but lack end-to-end encryption with robust authentication mechanisms. Our project enhances security by integrating cryptographic techniques to provide a comprehensive solution ensuring that emails remain confidential, authenticated, and unaltered during transmission.
Existing Solutions and LimitationsCurrent email security solutions primarily rely on TLS encryption, which only secures data in transit but does not protect stored emails. Some secure email services implement PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), but its key management complexity limits its widespread adoption. Our system overcomes these limitations by incorporating automated key distribution, ensuring every communication instance is independently secured without requiring complex user intervention.
Key Contributions of Our ProjectEnd-to-End Encryption: The system employs AES encryption for securing email contents and RSA for encrypting the AES key, ensuring that only the intended recipient can decrypt the message.
Authentication & Integrity: A SHA-512 hash is computed for each email and digitally signed using the sender’s private key. The receiver verifies the signature using the sender’s public key to ensure data authenticity and integrity.
Secure Key Distribution: The email server securely generates and shares RSA public-private key pairs and encrypted AES keys with both the sender and receiver.
Group Messaging Feature: Our newly added feature allows users to send emails to multiple recipients within a group using a single AES key per email, ensuring secure and efficient communication without compromising security.
This project effectively addresses the security challenges in traditional email systems by integrating modern cryptographic mechanisms. Through a structured encryption and authentication workflow, our Secure Email System ensures that users can communicate with complete security, preventing unauthorized access and maintaining the trustworthiness of the email exchange process.

OBJECTIVES:

Ensure Comprehensive Security: Implement robust end-to-end encryption using AES for message confidentiality, RSA for secure key exchange, and SHA-512 hashing to maintain data integrity.
